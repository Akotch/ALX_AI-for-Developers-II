üõ†Ô∏è Instructions

1.  Ensure your base project is scaffolded.
    - If not done yet, manually create the base Next.js project.
    - Use AI to organize the folder structure and generate placeholder files (e.g., /auth/login, /auth/register, /components/LoginForm.tsx).
2.  Use AI to help implement authentication features.
    - Prompt the AI to guide Supabase setup (client config, .env, auth context).
    - Implement a basic login form using shadcn/ui (you may use mock handlers or integrate with Supabase).
3.  Ask the AI to help with UI components and form logic.
    - Use inline completions and chat prompts to generate JSX layout, form handlers, and validation.
    - Feel free to ask for minimal styles and helpful UX cues.
4.  Commit iteratively as you go.
    - Generate commit messages with AI.
    - Use clear semantic labels like feat:, chore:, style:, etc.
5.  Push your changes to GitHub.

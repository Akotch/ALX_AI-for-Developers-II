üõ†Ô∏è Instructions

1.  **Pick a Function/Class/Component/Action**
    - Identify any function/class/component/action in your codebase that could benefit from optimization‚Äîe.g., vote handling, result tallying, filtering user polls.
2.  **Create a Before Snapshot**
    - Commit the original version to a branch called day8-before with the filename voteHandler-before.ts (or similar).
3.  **Prompt AI for a Refactor**
    - Ask your AI IDE to optimize the function: ‚ÄúCan you refactor this for readability and performance without changing its logic?‚Äù
    - Optionally follow up with: ‚ÄúWhy is this version more efficient?‚Äù
4.  **Review and Edit**: If needed, tweak the AI‚Äôs output to ensure correctness and maintainability.
5.  **Compare and Reflect**:
    - What changed?
    - Was performance improved in theory or in practice?
    - Would you keep this refactor in production?

## Tasks

##### 0\. Automated Code Review

##### 🎯 Goal

- Use CodeRabbit to automatically review a pull request on your GitHub repository and generate summary feedback, inline comments, and insights.
- Use CodeRabbit to review changes in your code before pushing to GitHub (in-IDE integration).

##### 🛠️ Instructions

1.  Make a meaningful code change in your project:

    - Refactor a function
    - Add a new feature or fix a bug
    - Modify an existing endpoint or client function

2.  Commit the changes locally and observe how CodeRabbit (in IDE) surfaces any review comments before you push.
3.  Push your changes and open a **pull request**.
4.  Review CodeRabbit’s output in GitHub:

    - Did it leave **inline comments**?
    - Did it generate a **summary review**?
    - Did it surface anything your IDE didn’t?

5.  Push a follow-up commit to the same PR with additional changes, then compare the new AI feedback.

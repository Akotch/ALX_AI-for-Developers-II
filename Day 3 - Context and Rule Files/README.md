🛠️ Instructions

1.  Create a project-specific rule file. You can use the format for your favorite IDE ( Cursor, Trae, Zed .. etc)
2.  Include at least 3–5 rules
    - Focus on real patterns from your app, like:
    - Folder structure (`/app/polls/`, `/app/api/`)
    - Form libraries (`react-hook-form`, `shadcn/ui`)
    - Supabase usage for auth and database
3.  Try using the AI to scaffold or refactor something
    - Example: “Create a form to submit a new poll”
4.  Notice whether it follows your rules or not and keep updating your rules with your observation

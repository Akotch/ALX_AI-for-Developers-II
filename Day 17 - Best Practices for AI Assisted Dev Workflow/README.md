## Tasks

##### 0\. Applying Your AI Dev Workflow

üéØ Goal

Develop and apply a structured, AI-enhanced development workflow to a real feature in your codebase‚Äîfrom planning to implementation and refactor.

---

üõ†Ô∏è Instructions

1.  **Choose a Feature**: Select a meaningful but manageable task (e.g., add a new route, introduce a utility function, or improve a UI component).
2.  **Plan with AI**: Use your IDE‚Äôs chat panel to brainstorm the architecture for the feature. Ask for:
    - Folder structure
    - Suggested function signatures
    - Security or performance considerations
3.  **Create a Project Rule File**: Based on the AI suggestions, generate a rule file with 3‚Äì5 high-level rules or patterns you want the AI to follow.
4.  **Implement with Context Anchors**: While building the feature, use in-editor context commands (e.g., @code, #file, @thread) to refine the code through inline and chat-based AI interactions.
5.  **Refactor and Review**
    - Ask AI to refactor the final code for readability or performance.
    - Run a git diff before and after the refactor.
    - Optionally, simulate a code review: prompt the AI to critique the final code for style and correctness.
6.  **Commit your work and share your experience** your work

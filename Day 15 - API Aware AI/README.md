## Tasks

##### 0\. API-Aware AI

#### 🎯 Goal

Use your in-IDE AI assistant to generate and refine client-side functions based on the Polly API specification, ensuring they align with the documented schema and behaviors.

#### 🛠️ Instructions

1.  Now based on the learning from the previous concept, based on the provided OpenAPI spec, generate two new client-side functions:

    ```
    -  🗳️ Create a client-side function to cast a vote on an existing Poll.
    -  📊  Create a client-side function that retrieves poll results.
    ```

2.  Review and revise the AI-generated code to ensure:

    - Required fields and request structure match the spec
    - Authentication is added where needed
    - Responses are handled based on expected status codes
    - Errors are logged or surfaced clearly
    - Response shapes match the schema

3.  Once your functions are working:

    - Add short docstrings to explain intent and inputs
    - (Optional) Add a test snippet or usage example

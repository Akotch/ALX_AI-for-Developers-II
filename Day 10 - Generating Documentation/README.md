## Tasks


üéØ Goal  
Enhance the ALX‚ÄØPolly codebase by adding clear, intentional documentation‚Äîcomprehensive docstrings for core functions, inline comments explaining complex logic, and an updated README that reflects current setup and usage.

üõ†Ô∏è Instructions  
1\. In your IDE (Trae, Cursor, Zed, or similar), use the built‚Äëin AI assistant to help generate initial docstrings and inline comments for:  
\- Authentication flows  
\- Poll management logic  
\- Voting system handlers  
\- User dashboard components  
2\. Review and refine the AI‚Äëgenerated output:  
\- Ensure each docstring explains both _what_ the code does and _why_  
\- Add or adjust inline comments for edge cases and complex logic  
3\. Update the **README.md** to include:  
\- Project overview and tech stack  
\- Setup steps (Supabase config, environment variables)  
\- Usage examples (creating polls, voting)  
\- How to run and test the app locally  
4\. Run the application to verify nothing breaks and all documentation integrates smoothly in your IDE.
